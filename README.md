**Week 11: CI/CD, environments, and Docker**

Learn: multi-stage Dockerfiles, env separation (dev/staging/prod), secrets management
Build: Dockerize API; GitHub Actions pipeline: build, test, deploy on merge to main
Deliverables:
Green pipeline with caching; rules for main branch; PR status checks
Resources: Docker docs, GitHub Actions examples

**Week 12: Observability and performance**

Learn: metrics vs logs vs traces; simple performance profiling; caching
Build: add pino logs, Prometheus metrics or simple health endpoints; Redis caching for list endpoints
Deliverables:
Performance improvement measured (e.g., response time reduced by X%)
Resources: pino, Redis docs, basic perf profiling guides

**Week 13: Advanced features (choose one)**

Option A: Realtime (WebSockets) for live task updates
Option B: Background jobs/queues (BullMQ) for email notifications
